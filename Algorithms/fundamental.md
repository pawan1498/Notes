# LCM 
- Least common multiple
- so lcm of two number is the smallest number which is devided by both the number.

- EX: LCM(2,3)
  multiple of 2: 2,4,6,8.....
  multiple of 3: 3,6,9,12,......

  so the smallest number will be 6 

# HCF highest common factor
- its will be the highest common factoe between two number 
- EX: HCf(12 , 27)
  factor of 12 : 1,2,3,4,6,12
  factor of 27 : 1,3,9,27
  
  SO the highest common factor will be 3

## Application 
We use H.C.F. method in the following fields:


To split things into smaller sections.


To equally distribute any number of sets of items into their largest grouping.


To figure out how many people we can invite.


To arrange something into rows or groups.
