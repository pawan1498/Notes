# Request life cycle 
- stateless and statefull 
## stateless
- the term "stateless" refers to the characteristic of not storing any information about the client's state on the server between requests. Stateless communication means that each request from a client to a server is independent and does not rely on any previous requests. Each request is treated as a standalone and complete operation.
                                                          OR    
- Stateless means that each request from a client to a server must contain all the information needed to understand and process the request. The server should not store any information about the client's state between requests.
  - RestAPi is an example of statless request. 

  
## stateful 
- The opposite of stateless is "stateful." In a stateful communication or system, the server retains information about the client's state between requests. This means that the server remembers the client's previous interactions and can use that information to respond to subsequent requests. Stateful systems often involve the use of sessions or cookies to maintain state information.




# REST API
- A REST API (Representational State Transfer Application Programming Interface) is a set of rules and conventions for building and interacting with web services. REST is an architectural style that uses standard HTTP methods and status codes for communication between clients and servers. 

-  REST (Representational State Transfer) architecture is statelessness.
