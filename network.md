# firewall
- A firewall is a network security system designed to monitor and control incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predetermined security rules. The primary purpose of a firewall is to establish a barrier between a trusted internal network and untrusted external networks, such as the internet.

- In Ubuntu, the default firewall management tool is typically UFW (Uncomplicated Firewall). If you're using UFW, you can follow these steps to check and modify firewall settings:
  - sudo ufw allow 3000
  - sudo ufw reload
  - sudo ufw status
