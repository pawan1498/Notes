## abstract method : 
- A method that is declare without an implementation 

## abstract class : 
- if a class Include abstract method , then the class itself called abstract class.

- General thing of abstract class : 
1. we can't create object of abstract class . 
2. abstract class act as parent class from which class can inherit and define those abstract method in subclass 
    then object can be created from this subclass. 
3. Example 
  1. class shape is an abstract class 
  2. In this abstract method are define like : Area , perimeter , volume etc.
  3. we can create subclass like 
      ex : class square
      in this class, i can define area in area method similarly perimeter etc 
4. ek bhi abstract method class mein present hua tho wo class bhi abstract class hogi. uska object nhi bnega then uske liye hume subclass mein us method ko define krna hoga , then uss class ka object bana skte hai
