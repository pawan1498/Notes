has_many : through vs has_and_belong_to_many 

- The has_and_belongs_to_many association in Rails is used to establish a many-to-many relationship between two models. It's the simplest way to set up such an association, and it's suitable when you only need a direct relationship between two models without the need for additional attributes on the join table.
- This join table typically contains only foreign keys referencing the primary keys of the associated models.
- With has_and_belongs_to_many, you don't create a separate model for the join table. Rails handles the association directly.

- The has_many through association is also used to establish a many-to-many relationship between two models, but it provides more flexibility than has_and_belongs_to_many. It allows you to work with the join table as its own model, enabling you to add additional attributes or methods to it.
